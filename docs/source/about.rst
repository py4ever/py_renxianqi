About the renxianqi
=====================================

This is a small tool to check the left and right panel difference.

renxianqi aka qingdian is a tool to compare the left panel and right panel to sort out the absentee list (save to clipboard)

人贤齐(万能清点）小工具，用来快速清点人数的。

请先安装运行，然后会打开一个UI界面。 左边为全部人员，右边为实际出席的人数。

然后点击'开始核对'，下方就会把左边还没有出席的人员打印输出。
